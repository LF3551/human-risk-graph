## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### 🎉 Initial Release

This is the first public release of Human Risk Graph (HRG), a quantitative model for measuring organizational security risk from human dependencies.

### ✨ Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Graph-based Risk Analysis**: Models organizational dependencies as directed graphs
- **Three Risk Metrics**:
  - **Bus Factor Score** (40% weight): Measures fragility from key person dependencies using articulation points
  - **Decision Concentration Score** (35% weight): Quantifies authority centralization using Gini coefficient
  - **Bypass Risk Score** (25% weight): Evaluates control override risks through critical path analysis
- **Composite HRG Score**: Weighted combination of all metrics for overall risk assessment

#### Command-Line Interface
- `hrg analyze` command for comprehensive organizational analysis
- `hrg visualize` command for interactive graph generation
- Multiple output formats: JSON, Markdown, HTML
- Beautiful terminal output with emoji indicators and formatted metrics
- Automatic report and visualization generation

#### Visualization
- **Interactive HTML graphs** using pyvis
- Risk-based node coloring (cyan → teal → yellow → orange → red)
- Hover tooltips with detailed node information
- Real-time graph manipulation (zoom, pan, drag)
- Embedded metrics legend
- Static PNG fallback using matplotlib

#### Reports
- **JSON reports**: Machine-readable analysis results
- **Markdown reports**: Human-readable documentation with recommendations
- **HTML reports**: Professional styled reports with dark theme
- Automatic risk level interpretation (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
- Actionable security recommendations based on findings

#### Development & Quality
- Comprehensive test suite (25 tests, 100% passing)
- Code formatting with Black (100 char line length)
- Linting with flake8
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Multi-version Python support (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)

#### Documentation
- Professional logo and branding
- Academic paper (LaTeX, arXiv-ready)
- Formal mathematical model with theorems and proofs
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- README with badges (CI, coverage, license, Python version, code style)

### 📊 Experimental Framework
- Synthetic data generation for 4 organizational topologies:
  - Hierarchical (traditional corporate)
  - Flat (modern startup)
  - Star (centralized authority)
  - Random (ad-hoc structure)
- Benchmark suite for algorithm validation
- Publication-quality visualization (300 DPI)

### 🔬 Algorithms
- **Tarjan's Algorithm** for articulation point detection (O(V+E))
- **Critical Path Analysis** for bypass risk assessment
- **Betweenness Centrality** for influence measurement
- **Gini Coefficient** for concentration measurement
- **Shannon Entropy** alternative for diversity metrics
