We present efficient algorithms for computing HRG metrics with polynomial time complexity.

\subsection{Bus Factor Algorithm}

Computing $BF(G)$ requires finding articulation points. We use Tarjan's algorithm.

\textbf{Time Complexity}: $O(|V| + |E|)$

\subsection{Decision Concentration Algorithm}

Computing $DC(G)$ requires collecting approval weights and computing the Gini coefficient.

\textbf{Time Complexity}: $O(|E| + |V| \log |V|)$ (dominated by sorting)

\subsection{Bypass Risk Algorithm}

Computing $BR(G)$ requires enumerating critical paths and checking for bypass edges.

\textbf{Time Complexity}: $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$ using breadth-first search with path tracking.
