We introduced the Human Risk Graph, a novel graph-theoretic model for quantifying organizational security risk from human dependencies. HRG provides three core metrics---Bus Factor Score, Decision Concentration Score, and Bypass Risk Score---that together identify structural vulnerabilities in organizational design.

Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A formal mathematical model with proofs of key properties
\item Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for all metrics
\item Experimental validation on synthetic and real organizational structures
\item A reference implementation in Python with comprehensive tests
\end{itemize}

HRG has practical applications in:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Security Architecture}: Identifying human single points of failure
\item \textbf{Business Continuity}: Assessing organizational resilience
\item \textbf{Insider Threat}: Proactive vulnerability assessment
\item \textbf{Organizational Design}: Optimizing authority distribution
\end{itemize}

Future work will extend HRG to dynamic and probabilistic settings, integrate with existing security frameworks, and develop automated mitigation strategies. We hope HRG contributes to a more holistic view of security risk that encompasses both technical and organizational factors.
