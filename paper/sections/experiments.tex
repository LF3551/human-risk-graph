We evaluate HRG on synthetic organizational topologies and real-world case studies.

\subsection{Datasets}

\textbf{Synthetic Data}: Generated organizations with 20-50 people in four topologies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hierarchical (tree structure)
\item Flat (peer network)
\item Star (centralized)
\item Random (arbitrary connections)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Real Data}: Anonymized organizational structures from three technology companies (details in appendix).

\subsection{Methodology}

For each dataset, we:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct the HRG from organizational data
\item Compute BF, DC, and BR scores
\item Compare with baseline metrics (degree centrality, betweenness centrality)
\item Analyze sensitivity to parameter changes
\end{enumerate}
